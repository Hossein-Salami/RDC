# RDC
A MATLAB project for modeling coupled reaction, diffusion, and crystallization processes in a biocatalytic reactive crystallization process.
Main.m defines intial parameters including vessel pH, total enzyme concentration, etc. It calls on Crystal.m and rate_calc.m to calculate the rate of reaction and crystallization at each instance in time.
